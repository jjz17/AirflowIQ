* Define config YAML file to pass dynamic parameters (location_id, time_interval, etc.) to pipeline for API data query and processing https://stackoverflow.com/questions/55300453/how-to-pass-dynamic-arguments-airflow-operator

* Practice time series analysis and prediction with this Ozone dataset before using OpenAQ Data https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/172/ozone+level+detection
  * Train ARIMA model and use other ML methods to forecast ozone concentration and other metrics related to respiratory health

# Next Steps
* Kafka
* CassandraDB
* CNN to predict air quality events (high ozone, pollution, etc.) from aerial/satellite images
  * Need to find database of these images, ideally with labels
